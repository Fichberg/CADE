Errors:

E1: Missed Entity. That is, did not mark entity when it should. Example: Had to mark one organization, but skipped it.
E2: Missed Classification. That is, marked a correct entity with the wrong classification. Example: an organization was marked as person.
E3: Precision Error. That is, within the annotation there is, indeed, part of what is considered to be correct. Example: Should mark "Braco do Brasil S.A.", but found "Banco do Brasil". E3 is considered to happen if we could easily correct just increasing or decreasing lower and higher bounds of the annotations indexes. For a more rigid consideration, precision error E3 + E2 are both errors that should never happen. E3 is being taken in consideration because most of the time it is not really a bad error, but just undesirable.
